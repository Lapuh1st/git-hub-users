# git-hub-users

Bulid with React/Redux-saga, as using Redux it was mandatory in test task.

I think more easy way would be just create some:

"useEffect" hook when page loaded with API call, ->
get data from api -> 
set it to useState hook

const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);

and then just render users.
